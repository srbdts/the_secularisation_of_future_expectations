ANNOTATION GUIDELINES
#####################

This document explains the annotation procedure that underpins the analyis in the accompanying paper. 

In a first round of annotation, I separated the divine appeals (where God is invoked) from the cases where God was mentioned but not appealed to. The divine appeals where subsequently provided with annotations for the following parameters:

	- part of the letter they occurred in (dateline, opening section, body, closing section)
	- temporal orientation (past, present, future)
	- domain of life that the divine entity is invoked for:
			- disease and death
			- law, politics and warfare
			- money, work and finances
			- religion
			- social life
			- travel, transport and communication
			- general

Because this paper focuses in particular on those appeals that are oriented towards the future, these were separated from the ones that dealt with the past. Because agency appeared to be the most important factor to distinguish between various types of future-oriented appeals, I annotated all hits for the variable "control", indicating whether the action involved was portrayed within the sphere of control of:
	- a human (the writer, the addressee or a third party)
	- a divine entity
	- no one at all
	- a combination of these actors 

Based on this variable, the attestations were then classified as "divine approval" (human and God in control), "confidence" (God in control, but human pretends to know the outcome), "prayer" (God in control, but human asks God to take care of it to their own benefit) or "resignation" (God in control, human does not try to influence Him in His decisions). As such, these categories have been developed in close interaction with the data at hand and emanate from a (lower-level) annotation scheme that required less interpretation and more tagging of objective discursive phenomena.

The remainder of this document contains the actual annotation scheme that was compiled during and used for the analysis.
