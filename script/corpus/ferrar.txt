Since there is nothing more certaine then death nor more uncertaine
then the time when I have thought it the first and chiefest for wisdom~
of a ma~ to prepare himselfe for that w=ch= must one day comm~ and
always to bee ready for that w=ch= may every hower happen . Especially
considering how daungerouse any errour is heere w=ch= $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} bee amended . neither is {TEXT:a} any man anything the
nearer to death for {TEXT:being} having prepared for it . it is then a
thing of exceeding madness and folly to bee necgligente in soe weighty
a matter in respect wherof all other things are trifles .
