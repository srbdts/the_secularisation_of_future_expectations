But now more lately , after divers meetings , when I thought all anger
had bin past , his Lordship was pleased to come and prosecute his
Visitation in the Chapter house , and there presently to tell us that
now he intended to proceed against them that had misbehaved themselves
towards him , and first of all to begin with me , whom first he meant
to be rid of , and to rid me out of the Church . For which purpose he
had drawne certeine articles of misdemeanour against me <paren> of
which I trow the pretended <P_I,205> articles exhibited against him to
your Lordship and the letter are the greatest </paren> which he willed
his Registrar to enact and record , with an admonition to appeare 14
dayes after . Wherupon I perceive his Lordship 's displeasure lyeth
hard upon me , although I have laboured many waies to observe him , and
no way to give him any just cause of offence , not knowing wherin it is
I shold so displease him , unlesse it were in being with Dr. Lindsell
at Fulham , when your Lordship was acquainted with the alteration of
our Church service , and in deferring my voyce to the confirmation of

Bishops of Durham then a benefitt , and that the reserved rent would be
a great advantage : whereas in truth it was the quite contrary , my

1=st=. The scituation of the Castle , which stands at the head of the
City , and by it , and a wall adjoyning to it strikes quite through
from one side of the City wall to an other , in such a manner that if
you could continue the City any further then the Castle gates , to make
the communication further you must pass through the Castle gates ;

for , in truth , those gates which we commonly call the Gaole gates are
the Castle gates , the Gaole being part of the Castle , to wit , the
outwardmost part , COSIN,II,385.084.2061

for by ancient histories it appeares that was the intention of building
it at first , conteining such a compass of ground as would conteine a
competent number of households for the defence of the Castle , which
hold by Castle gard to come in time of danger to defend the Castle , as
by ancient records doth appeare , should suffer such a communication as
would much weaken the defence of it , as it must needs do if the City
extended through the Castle , COSIN,II,386.084.2064

for then it would be necessary for the government of the City that the
chiefe Governor thereof should at all times have libertie as well in

and indeed I thinke if one part of the citizens were tyed to the
defence of the Castle all the rest should be so too , which it is
cleare $they $'re {TEXT:they're} not . COSIN,II,386.084.2066

The City of Durham being a Mannor , and having view of Frank pledge
within one circuit of ground , and the Castle being an other Mannor ,
and having view of Frank pledge in an other circuit , and , I believe ,
it was never heard that one and the same City should have two distinct
jurisdictions , which , in truth , is a contradiction in adjecto ;

but two distinct jurisdictions by her several chiefe Governors <paren>
as the Constable of the Castle , and the chiefe Magistrate of the City

And this reason is confirmed to me by the constant practice and the
words of the Charter , which doth comprehend the whole City to be
