Chiromanticall observations concerning nayles are of litle verity and
slender use unto us , nor to $be compared with medicall observations ,
while wee make no ungroundlesse conjecture from their grossenesse ,
ruggednesse , incurvation and inequality ; while wee find them pale &
wanne infayntings , in the invasion of Quartans , Reddish in
plethoricall persons , ill colourd in cacochymicall bodyes , blackish
in the black , and yellowe in the yellow Jaundis . BROWNE,94.014.277

The nayles are also of a substance tingible and outwardly colourable ,
as is to bee seen in some trades ; and as I have seen in the Dominions
of the Turk , where some not only guild the nayles , butt many colour
them of a reddish colour which may bee anywhere performed by the power
of Alcanna or Cua steeped in wine or wine & water and imbibing the
tincture in a cloath to laye it upon the nayles some howers ,

Butt the nayles are more especially to bee taken notice of by
chirurgeons in reference unto the diseases , particularly the
paronuchia , or pars antium , on the extreme parts of the fingers
toward the side of the nayle , which affordeth great payne & torture ,
as also for the cleare taking of the nayles with the skinne in the
excoriation of human bodyes , and likewise because the exquisite paring
of the nayles was practised by Barbers and is still used in Italie ;
because {TEXT:as} there ought to bee some good caution in the cutting
of the nayles , from the errour wherein gangraens have sometimes
succeeded . BROWNE,94.014.282

stagnation of the fresh waters ; wch is thus , vizt . That the sea
having its passage upon the ebbs and flows thereof , along by the coast
of Norfolke , to the coast of Lincolnshire , did in tyme by reason of
its muddinesse , leave a shelfe of silt betwixt those two points of
land , Vzt <font> Rising </font> in Norfolke , and the country about
<font> Spilsby </font> in Lincolnshire , wch shelfe increasing in
height , at length so much , as that the ordinary tides did not
overflow it , was by that check of those fluxes , in time , so much
<P_318> augmented in breadth , that the Romans finding it considerable
for the fertility of the soyle , <paren> being a people of great
ingenuity and industry </paren> made the first sea banks for its
preservation from the spring tides wch might otherwise overflow it .
