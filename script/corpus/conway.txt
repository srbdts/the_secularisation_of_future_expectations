and the melting of metalls by Tuball Cain , the two latter of which

may be a greif that is so unprofitable , nay mischievous , and consyder
that that passion which moves in you now is altogether unseasonable ,

more moment and more desireable then the Talmudicall , they being a
greater rarity and of such a nature that few have any ability or genius
to deale with them by reason of their invincible obscurity , which if
they be either totally or in a good part disinvolved of by the paines
of Peganius , the Rarity of them , me thinks may make them more
desireable then those of the Talmud , they being of another nature and
more ordinarily known . CONWAY,390.073.2058
