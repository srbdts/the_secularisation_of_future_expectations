, and howe litle he regarded any affection or cause that might move him
to fauour either thone or thother parte more thenne becam a prince
indifferent , and soo indifferent that knowing them both to be princes
of honour and his Dere Freendes and Allyes , he could haue been content
with his travail charge and greate expenses to haue been the meane to
