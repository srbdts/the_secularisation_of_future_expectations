I have bene long a wittnesse how much the lord hath shewed his
well-wishing to your soule , besides those actuall workings <P_129> of
his spirit which hath bene a comfort to many , though it seemes that
for the matter of assurance he hath not dealt so largely with you as
with many of his saints , wherby as you are hindred of much comfort
which others doe injoy more constantly , so you $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
have so large a measure of love to your God againe when you doe not so
certainly and confidently beleeve that many sins are forgiven you .
