enioy'd in your late choice , a Lady not onely very good in her self ,
but suitable to your disposition , which certainly is the highest point
of blessing which marriage can possibly afford you , especially when I
consider that your disposition is , to be religious towards your God ,
faithful to your freinds , beneficiall to your neigbors , good to all
that have any relation to you , that though you know how to make use of
that which is call'd the happyness of this life , yet you sett not your
heart upon it , but make your self such freinds of it , as may lead you
on to an happyness that can have no end , and of which the former
